# Supplementary
This code reproduces all results in the corncob manuscript.

Simulations were conducted using the (highly recommended!) [simulator R package](http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~bien/simulator.html) (Bien, 2016).

Shell scripts and parts of the parallelization are specific to the computing systems used.
To run the code on any computer, remove the parallel component of calls to `run_method()`.
